# FileVisitor temp README

For this project, I used the visitor pattern to populate a series of object and visitor object connections. The input takes a file of strings and assigns them to objects. The visitors then made adjustments to the strings and had to keep track of for example, capital letters, palindromes, length etc. and do proper updates. The objects were then stored in a binary tree for easy lookup.
